        I pivoted from high intensity and high speed sales jobs to high intensity and 
        high speed restraunt managment jobs and I'm ready to pivot again to a high 
        intensity and high speed coding job!  Stress is a way of life!

            Like most (very few) developers, I started coding basic html on neopets when I was ten years old.  
            I've since taken a few classes on html, css, and javascript; most notably the Thinkful Engineering Immersion course, which I'm told 
            has a 91% rate of finding a coding related job within 90 days.  You wouldn't want to be in the bottom 9%, would you?
            <br>
            On a more serious note, I'm inexperienced but qualified.  I can be hired for cheap and molded into what you want!  Win/Win!

           My passions include appearing on the radio to debate climate change, overanalyzing geopolitics from my bedroom, and running a dungeons and 
            dragons campaign (second edition) that is nearing it's tenth year of life with no sign of stopping!
