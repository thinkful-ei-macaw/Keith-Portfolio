            I pivoted from high intensity and high speed sales jobs to high intensity and 
            high speed restraunt managment jobs and I'm ready to pivot again to a high 
            intensity and high speed coding job!  Stress is a way of life!</p><p>
            One might be unfamiliar with how these possisions could possibly be relevant to 
            a coding environment; but if working Sales has taught me one thing, it's how to 
            talk to people and be personable.  Managing a restraunt is all about working on a 
            team, which is also an important aspect of any dev team.

            Like most (very few) developers, I started coding basic html4 on neopets when I was ten years old.  
            I've since taken a few classes on html, css, and javascript; most notably the Thinkful Engineering Immersion course, which I'm told 
            has a 91% rate of finding a coding related job within 90 days.  You wouldn't want to be in the bottom 9%, would you?
            </p>
            <p>
            On a more serious note, I'm inexperienced but qualified; my inexperience is somewhat of an advantage as I don't have 
            any bad coding habits and  I can be molded into what you need without me having to unlearn an old style!

            It goes against my nature to try and sell myself, so I'm going to just be candid 
            and hope my sincerity serves as a replacement for strict professionalism. I'm a strongly opinionated person. 
            I've always thought that the so-called Golden Rule of <q>Do unto others as you would have them do to you</q> is only 
            applicable in a meek, uninterested society. I want to be challenged, to argue, to kick and scream in the pursuit of 
            truth and merit, and ultimately I want nuance over broad brushstrokes. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Coding, in a way, is an outlet for me. It's a form of expression and creation that lets me experiment and develop and 
            improve. It's challenging for me, which is what draws me to it. If it came naturally and was always easy it wouldn't be as 
            stimulating as it is. And that stimulation and struggle is the foundation of my pitch for you to hire me. I'll struggle on your 
            behalf, until we're both satisfied that what I've created is truly worthwhile.
            </p>
            <p>
           My passions apart from coding include appearing on the radio to debate climate change, overanalyzing geopolitics from my bedroom, 
           and running a dungeons and dragons campaign (second edition) that is nearing it's tenth year of life with no sign of stopping!

            This is the first Capstone Project done for Thinkful made in two weeks.  It is a fullstack app 
            that uses React and Node (and CSS, of course).  Maeglin manages user created content for 
            second edition Dungeons and Dragons (the last edition to be made by the creator, Gary Gygax.)  
            It allows users to browse content as well as create it by making GET and POST calls to the API.

                This is the second Thinkful EI Capstone made in a single week.  It is a fullstack app 
                made with React and Node (and CSS, obviously).  This is an app for learning the Klingon language 
                using a proven technique called Spaced Repitition.  Much like the first capstone, it uses a custom 
                built RESTful API and has a heavy focus on testing using Express, Mocha, Chai, Supertest, and Nodemon.
                Other technologies it utilizes are BcryptJS, Postgrator, Morgan, and several others.
