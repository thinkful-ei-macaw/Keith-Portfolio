            This is the second Thinkful EI project.  This one was a fair bit tougher as there was a lot less hand holding on this one.  This app 
            allows the user to add bookmarks, edit them, rate them, and delete them.
            Please don't mind the hideous styling; there weren't any points for style, so don't look at it as ugly--look at it as efficient!
